# NixOS configuration

My system and user configuration, all managed by Nix.

To use this configuration on NixOS, run:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

You're going to need to enable flakes first.
You can find a really good book about NixOS, flakes and home-manager [here](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world).
